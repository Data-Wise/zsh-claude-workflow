# Write Abstract

Draft a concise, structured abstract for research papers or presentations.

## Required Input

- **Paper/Project Summary**: What is the research about?
- **Target Venue**: Journal, conference, or purpose
- **Word Limit**: Typically 150-300 words
- **Type**: Structured (with headings) or unstructured

## Process

1. **Identify Key Elements**: Background, methods, results, conclusions
2. **Draft Core Sentences**: One sentence per element
3. **Expand Appropriately**: Fill to word limit without padding
4. **Polish Language**: Active voice, precise terminology
5. **Check Requirements**: Venue-specific formatting

## Output Format

### Structured Abstract (Common in Medical/Psych Journals)

```markdown
**Background**: [1-2 sentences on context and gap]

**Objective**: [1 sentence stating aim]

**Methods**: [2-3 sentences on design, sample, analysis]

**Results**: [2-3 sentences on key findings with numbers]

**Conclusions**: [1-2 sentences on implications]

**Keywords**: [3-5 terms]
```

### Unstructured Abstract (Common in Statistics/Methods)

```markdown
[Opening sentence establishing context and importance]
[Sentence identifying the gap or problem]
[Sentence stating the objective/contribution]
[2-3 sentences describing the approach/methods]
[2-3 sentences presenting key results]
[Closing sentence on implications and significance]
```

## Key Elements

### Background (10-15%)
- Establish context
- Identify the gap or problem
- Why does this matter?

### Objective (5-10%)
- Clear statement of aim
- "We propose...", "This paper examines...", "We develop..."

### Methods (20-30%)
- Study design
- Sample/data
- Key analytical approach
- NO excessive detail

### Results (30-40%)
- Main findings with specific numbers
- Effect sizes, confidence intervals
- "We found that..." not "Results will be discussed"

### Conclusions (15-20%)
- What do the results mean?
- Implications for theory/practice
- Avoid overgeneralization

## Venue-Specific Tips

### Statistical Journals (JASA, Biometrics)
- Lead with methodological contribution
- Include theoretical properties
- Mention computational aspects
- Application as illustration

### Psychological Journals (Psych Methods, JEP)
- Emphasize practical implications
- Include effect sizes
- Note limitations briefly
- Structured format often required

### Conference Abstracts
- Hook readers quickly
- Be specific about contribution
- Mention what you'll present
- Often shorter (150-200 words)

## Example Prompts

"Write an abstract for a methods paper on mediation analysis with three sequential mediators. Target: Psychological Methods. 250-word limit, structured format."

"Draft a conference abstract for JSM on a new bootstrap method for indirect effects. 200 words, must highlight novel contribution."

"Create an abstract for a JASA submission on Bayesian methods for causal mediation. Emphasize theoretical contributions. 300 words."

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] States clear objective
- [ ] Describes methods specifically
- [ ] Includes quantitative results
- [ ] Draws appropriate conclusions
- [ ] Meets word limit
- [ ] Uses active voice
- [ ] Avoids jargon/acronyms (or defines them)
- [ ] Stands alone (no citations needed)
- [ ] Keywords are appropriate

## Integration with MCP Skills

- **methods-paper-writer**: For full paper context
- **publication-strategist**: For venue selection
- **methods-communicator**: For clarity improvements

## Tips

1. **Write Last**: Abstract is easier after paper is complete
2. **Be Specific**: Vague abstracts get rejected
3. **Numbers Matter**: Include key statistics
4. **No Suspense**: State findings clearly, don't tease
5. **Read Aloud**: Check for flow and clarity
6. **Get Feedback**: Have someone unfamiliar with project read it
