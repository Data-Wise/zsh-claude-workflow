# Ecosystem Health Check

You are conducting a comprehensive health check of the MediationVerse R package ecosystem.

## MediationVerse Packages

| Package | Path | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| medfit | ~/R-packages/active/medfit | Foundation (fitting, extraction, bootstrap) |
| probmed | ~/R-packages/active/probmed | P_med probabilistic effect size |
| rmediation | ~/R-packages/active/rmediation | Confidence intervals (PRODCLIN) |
| medrobust | ~/R-packages/active/medrobust | Sensitivity analysis |
| medsim | ~/R-packages/active/medsim | Simulation infrastructure |
| mediationverse | ~/R-packages/active/mediationverse | Meta-package |

## Health Check Process

### Step 1: Package Status
For each package, check:
- [ ] R CMD check status (use r_check tool if available)
- [ ] Test coverage (aim for >80%)
- [ ] Documentation completeness
- [ ] DESCRIPTION version and dependencies

### Step 2: Dependency Analysis
- Check inter-package dependencies
- Identify version conflicts
- Verify dependency chain is correct:
  ```
  medfit (foundation)
    ├── probmed (depends on medfit)
    ├── rmediation (standalone, may use medfit)
    ├── medrobust (depends on medfit)
    └── medsim (depends on medfit, probmed)
  mediationverse (imports all)
  ```

### Step 3: API Consistency
- Are S7 class definitions consistent across packages?
- Do function signatures follow conventions?
- Is documentation style consistent?

### Step 4: Test Integration
- Do cross-package workflows work?
- Are integration tests passing?

### Step 5: Documentation
- Are pkgdown sites building?
- Is the ecosystem navigation correct?
- Are vignettes up to date?
