## Response Strategies by Comment Type

### Methodological Concerns
- Acknowledge the validity of the concern
- Explain your rationale or provide additional justification
- If appropriate, add robustness checks or sensitivity analyses
- Reference literature supporting your approach

### Missing Citations
- Thank reviewer for the suggestion
- Add relevant citations
- Briefly note how they relate to your work

### Clarity Issues
- Thank reviewer for highlighting confusion
- Explain how you've revised for clarity
- Quote the new text if helpful

### Requests for Additional Analysis
- If feasible, perform the analysis
- If not feasible, explain why respectfully
- Offer alternative analyses if appropriate

### Disagreements
- Acknowledge the reviewer's perspective
- Provide evidence for your position
- Be willing to compromise when possible
- Remain professional and constructive

## Tone Guidelines

**Do:**
- Express genuine gratitude
- Be specific about changes made
- Acknowledge valid criticisms
- Explain your reasoning clearly

**Don't:**
- Be defensive or dismissive
- Argue aggressively
- Ignore comments (address everything)
- Over-promise changes you can't deliver

## Example Prompts

"Here are the reviewer comments for my mediation methods paper submitted to Psychological Methods. Help me draft responses. [paste comments]"

"Reviewer 2 is asking for additional simulations. The comment is: '[paste comment]'. We've already added the simulations. Help me write a response that describes what we did."

"This reviewer seems to misunderstand our approach. The comment is: '[paste comment]'. Help me write a respectful response that clarifies without being defensive."

## Integration with MCP Skills

This command works well with:
- **publication-strategist**: For strategic response planning
- **methods-communicator**: For explaining technical details clearly
- **manuscript-section**: For revising specific sections

## Tips

1. **Track Everything**: Keep a changelog of all revisions
2. **Be Thorough**: Address every point, even minor ones
3. **Highlight Changes**: Use track changes or colored text in revised manuscript
4. **Stay Positive**: Frame even disagreements constructively
5. **Proofread**: Errors in the response letter reflect poorly
