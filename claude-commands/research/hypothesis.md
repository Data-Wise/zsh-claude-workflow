# Formulate Hypotheses

Develop clear, testable research hypotheses from research questions.

## Purpose

Transform research ideas into:
- Precise, testable hypotheses
- Appropriate statistical hypotheses (H0/H1)
- Directional vs. non-directional forms
- Primary and secondary hypotheses

## Required Input

- **Research question**: What you want to investigate
- **Theory/rationale**: Why you expect certain relationships
- **Variables**: Key constructs and their operationalization
- **Study design**: Experimental, observational, etc.

## Process

1. Clarify the research question
2. Identify key variables and relationships
3. Specify expected direction of effects (if applicable)
4. Formulate conceptual hypotheses
5. Translate to statistical hypotheses
6. Consider alternative hypotheses

## Hypothesis Development

### Research Question
[Refined research question]

### Theoretical Rationale
[Brief theory supporting expected relationships]

### Variables
- **Independent/Predictor**: [Variable and operationalization]
- **Dependent/Outcome**: [Variable and operationalization]
- **Mediator** (if applicable): [Variable]
- **Moderator** (if applicable): [Variable]
- **Covariates**: [Control variables]

### Conceptual Hypotheses

**H1** (Primary): [Plain language hypothesis]
- Rationale: [Why expected]

**H2** (Secondary): [Plain language hypothesis]
- Rationale: [Why expected]

### Statistical Hypotheses

**H1**:
- H₀: [Null hypothesis in statistical terms]
- H₁: [Alternative hypothesis in statistical terms]
- Test: [Appropriate statistical test]

**H2**:
- H₀: [Null]
- H₁: [Alternative]
- Test: [Test]

### Directionality
- [ ] One-tailed (directional)
- [ ] Two-tailed (non-directional)
- Justification: [Why this choice]

### Effect Size Expectations
- Expected magnitude: [Small/Medium/Large]
- Basis for expectation: [Prior literature, pilot data]
```

## Hypothesis Types

### By Direction
- **Directional**: Specifies direction (X increases Y)
- **Non-directional**: No direction (X affects Y)

### By Role
- **Primary**: Main research question
- **Secondary**: Supporting questions
- **Exploratory**: No strong prior expectation

### By Relationship
- **Main effect**: Direct X → Y relationship
- **Interaction**: X × Z → Y
- **Mediation**: X → M → Y
- **Moderation**: Effect of X on Y depends on Z

## Tips

- Be specific and falsifiable
- One hypothesis per relationship
- Distinguish prediction from hypothesis
- Consider statistical power implications
- Pre-register when possible

## Examples

**Request**: "Develop hypotheses for studying the effect of mindfulness training on stress levels"

**Request**: "Formulate mediation hypotheses for social support → coping → depression"

**Request**: "Create hypotheses for a 2x2 factorial design on learning interventions"

**Request**: "Help me specify null and alternative hypotheses for my regression analysis"

## Common Pitfalls

- Hypotheses that aren't testable
- Confusing correlation with causation
- Over-specifying (too many hypotheses)
- Under-specifying (too vague)
- Forgetting to justify directionality
