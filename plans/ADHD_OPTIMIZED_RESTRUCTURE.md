# ADHD-Optimized Ecosystem Restructure

> **Date:** 2025-12-10
> **Purpose:** Restructure the entire ecosystem plan for ADHD productivity
> **Focus:** Clear hierarchies, minimal decisions, maximum automation

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary (READ THIS FIRST)

### The Problem with Current Plan

The current ecosystem has **5 planning documents totaling ~4,000 lines**. This creates:

❌ **Choice paralysis** - Too many options, no clear "do this first"
❌ **Context switching** - Scattered across multiple long documents
❌ **Decision fatigue** - Every step requires choosing between alternatives
❌ **No immediate action** - Everything is planning, nothing is executable
❌ **Overwhelming complexity** - Need to read thousands of lines to start

### ADHD-Optimized Principles

✅ **ONE thing to do right now** - No choices, just execute
✅ **Visual hierarchy** - See everything at a glance
✅ **Automation over decisions** - Let tools choose for you
✅ **Micro-tasks** - 5-15 minute chunks
✅ **Clear success criteria** - Know when you're done
✅ **External memory** - Tools remember, not you
✅ **Hyperfocus-friendly** - Deep work on one thing

---

## 📍 START HERE: Your One Thing Right Now

**ACTION:** Open the workspace file to see your MediationVerse ecosystem

```bash
code ~/projects/r-packages/mediationverse-dev.code-workspace
```

**Why this first:**
- Takes 30 seconds
- Provides immediate visual clarity
- No decisions required
- Enables everything else

**What you'll see:**
```
EXPLORER
 📁 1-medfit (foundation)     ← Start here when changing APIs
 📁 2-probmed                 ← Uses medfit
 📁 3-rmediation              ← Uses medfit
 📁 4-medrobust               ← Uses medfit
 📁 5-medsim                  ← Uses medfit, probmed, medrobust
 📁 6-mediationverse (meta)   ← Uses everything
```

**Success criteria:** You can see all 6 packages in one window

---

## 🗂️ Teaching Course Organization

### Option 1: Dedicated Teaching Repo (RECOMMENDED for ADHD)

**Structure:**
```
~/teaching/
├── courses/
│   ├── stats-415/           # Statistical Methods
│   ├── stats-535/           # Advanced Regression
│   └── stats-630/           # Experimental Design
│
├── materials/               # Shared across courses
│   ├── datasets/
│   ├── templates/
│   └── examples/
│
├── generated/               # Auto-generated by examify
│   ├── exams/
│   ├── quizzes/
│   └── homework/
│
└── CLAUDE.md                # Teaching-specific instructions
```

**Why best for ADHD:**
- ✅ Single location - No searching across repos
- ✅ Clear separation - Teaching ≠ Research ≠ Development
- ✅ One mental context - "I'm teaching" → `cd ~/teaching`
- ✅ Easy backup - One directory to sync
- ✅ No git complexity - Simple, flat structure

**Command to create:**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/teaching/{courses/{stats-415,stats-535,stats-630},materials/{datasets,templates,examples},generated/{exams,quizzes,homework}}
```

### Option 2: Inside R Packages (NOT RECOMMENDED)

**Structure:**
```
~/projects/r-packages/active/medfit/
├── vignettes/               # Package documentation
├── inst/
│   └── teaching/            # Teaching materials
│       ├── exercises/
│       └── examples/
```

**Why NOT good for ADHD:**
- ❌ Context switching - Teaching mixed with development
- ❌ Git noise - Course updates clutter package commits
- ❌ Hard to find - Buried inside package structure
- ❌ Scattered - Each package has own teaching folder

### Option 3: Quarto Projects (ALTERNATIVE)

**Structure:**
```
~/projects/quarto/teaching/
├── stats-415/
│   ├── index.qmd
│   ├── lectures/
│   └── assignments/
```

**Why might work for ADHD:**
- ✅ Visual output - Quarto renders to websites
- ✅ Self-contained - Everything in one project
- ❌ Publishing complexity - Requires build step
- ❌ Mixed with other Quarto projects

### 🎯 RECOMMENDATION: Option 1 (Dedicated Teaching Repo)

**One command setup:**
```bash
# Create structure
mkdir -p ~/teaching/{courses/{stats-415,stats-535,stats-630},materials,generated}

# Add to Claude Code workspace
echo '~/teaching' >> ~/.claude/workspace-paths.txt

# Initialize with teaching-specific CLAUDE.md
cp ~/projects/dev-tools/zsh-claude-workflow/templates/CLAUDE-teaching.md ~/teaching/CLAUDE.md
```

**Integration with existing tools:**
- examify generates files → `~/teaching/generated/`
- Course materials → `~/teaching/courses/stats-415/`
- Shared datasets → `~/teaching/materials/datasets/`
- Git repo → Push to GitHub when semester complete

## 🧠 ADHD Analysis of Current Plan

### Problem 1: Too Many Documents

**Current:**
- ECOSYSTEM_INTEGRATION_ANALYSIS.md (850 lines)
- PARALLEL_AGENT_PLAN.md (700 lines)
- MEDIATIONVERSE_ECOSYSTEM_STRATEGY.md (600 lines)
- UPSTREAM_COORDINATION_STRATEGY.md (800 lines)
- ECOSYSTEM_SYSTEM_EXPLAINED.md (1000 lines)
- OPTION_A_TEST_RESULTS.md (387 lines)

**Total:** ~4,000 lines across 6 files

**ADHD Impact:**
- Need to remember which document has what
- No single source of truth
- Can't see the big picture
- Overwhelming to review

**FIX:** Consolidate into 3 levels

### Problem 2: No Clear Next Action

**Current:** Every document ends with "What would you like to do?"
- Options A, B, C, D
- Decision required
- No default path

**ADHD Impact:**
- Decision paralysis
- Postpone indefinitely
- Forget what the options were

**FIX:** Default action always provided, opt-out if needed

### Problem 3: Manual Workflows

**Current:** From OPTION_A_TEST_RESULTS.md
```bash
# Manual workflow to test if probmed works with new medfit:
cd ~/projects/r-packages/active/medfit
R CMD INSTALL .

cd ~/projects/r-packages/active/probmed
R CMD check .

# Did it pass? What broke? Manual interpretation required
```

**ADHD Impact:**
- Too many steps to remember
- Easy to forget where you were
- No automation

**FIX:** One command does everything

### Problem 4: Long Explanations Before Action

**Current:** ECOSYSTEM_SYSTEM_EXPLAINED.md
- 200 lines explaining Remotes field
- 150 lines explaining revdepcheck
- 300 lines on workflows
- THEN "here's what to do"

**ADHD Impact:**
- Lose focus before reaching action items
- Re-read every time (forget previous reading)
- Explanation ≠ Execution

**FIX:** Action first, explanation on demand

## 🔄 Restructured Workflow

### Current Workflow (ADHD-Unfriendly)

```
1. Read ECOSYSTEM_SYSTEM_EXPLAINED.md (1000 lines)
2. Understand 5-layer system
3. Choose between Option A/B/C
4. Read relevant section (200 lines)
5. Execute manual steps (10 commands)
6. Interpret results manually
7. Decide what to do next
8. Repeat
```

**ADHD Barriers:** 8 decision points, ~1500 lines of reading, manual execution

### New Workflow (ADHD-Optimized)

```
1. ecosystem check-breaks medfit
   ↓
2. See visual output:
   ✓ probmed - No issues
   ✗ rmediation - 2 tests failed
   ✓ medrobust - No issues

3. Auto-opens rmediation/tests/testthat/test-*.R at failing lines
   ↓
4. Fix issues
   ↓
5. ecosystem check-breaks medfit --recheck
   ↓
6. ✓ All clear - safe to commit
```

**ADHD Benefits:** 1 decision point, 0 lines of reading, automated execution

## 🛠️ Automation Commands to Build

Based on ADHD principles, prioritize these:

### Priority 1: Reduce Manual Steps (Build FIRST)

**Command:** `ecosystem check-breaks <package>`

**What it does:**
1. Installs package locally
2. Tests all packages that depend on it
3. Shows visual summary
4. Opens failing tests in editor

**Why ADHD-friendly:**
- One command does everything
- Visual output (color-coded)
- Automatic focus (opens relevant files)
- Clear success criteria (all green)

**Estimated build time:** 2 hours

---

**Command:** `ecosystem install-dev <package>`

**What it does:**
1. Reads DESCRIPTION
2. Checks for packages not on CRAN
3. Auto-adds Remotes field with local paths
4. Installs with dependencies

**Why ADHD-friendly:**
- No manual editing of DESCRIPTION
- No need to remember paths
- Works every time
- One command

**Estimated build time:** 1 hour

---

**Command:** `ecosystem status-all`

**What it does:**
```
📦 MediationVerse Ecosystem Status

1-medfit       [●] 2 uncommitted files
2-probmed      [✓] Clean
3-rmediation   [!] Behind upstream 3 commits
4-medrobust    [✓] Clean
5-medsim       [●] 1 uncommitted file
6-mediationverse [✓] Clean

⚠ Action needed:
  - Commit changes in medfit
  - Pull rmediation
  - Commit changes in medsim
```

**Why ADHD-friendly:**
- See everything at once
- Clear indicators
- Tells you what to do
- External memory (don't have to remember status)

**Estimated build time:** 1.5 hours

### Priority 2: Reduce Decisions (Build SECOND)

**Command:** `ecosystem auto-coordinate`

**What it does:**
1. Detects you changed medfit
2. Automatically runs check-breaks
3. If clean: offers to commit
4. If broken: opens failing tests
5. After fixes: re-checks automatically

**Why ADHD-friendly:**
- Zero decisions
- Just run and follow prompts
- Opinionated workflow (the right way™)
- Can't forget steps

**Estimated build time:** 2 hours

### Priority 3: External Memory (Build THIRD)

**Command:** `ecosystem remember`

**What it does:**
- Saves current state before context switch
- "I was working on medfit adding S7 support, next I need to update probmed tests"

**Command:** `ecosystem recall`

**What it does:**
- Restores state
- Opens files you had open
- Shows your note about what's next
- Continues where you left off

**Why ADHD-friendly:**
- Don't have to remember
- Safe context switching
- Easy to return after interruption

**Estimated build time:** 2.5 hours

## 🗺️ Simplified Project Map

### Layer 1: Daily Work (Where You Spend Time)

```
~/projects/r-packages/active/
└── [6 MediationVerse packages]    ← Work here
    Tools: ecosystem commands, workspace file

~/teaching/
└── [Course materials]              ← Work here
    Tools: examify, quarto
```

### Layer 2: Infrastructure (Set and Forget)

```
~/projects/dev-tools/
├── zsh-claude-workflow/            ← ecosystem commands live here
├── claude-r-dev/                   ← R package profiles
└── claude-statistical-research/    ← MCP server
```

### Layer 3: Coordination (GitHub Only)

```
